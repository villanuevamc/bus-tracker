# Real Time Bus Tracker
This Real Time Bus Tracker exercise contains code for showing the bus stops between Harvard and MIT using the MBTA bus data. It uses an animated marker to highlight the bus routes on the displayed map.

## How To Run
In order to run this code after cloning the repo, open index.html in a browser. From there, click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to start the animation.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the future, the hope is to improve on this project with the addition of "Stop" and "Start" buttons that will allow the user to have more control over the animation. Another potential improvement would be to show a line tracking the routes to follow the animated marker to better visualize the route.
